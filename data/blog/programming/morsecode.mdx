# Introduction #

As of 2023 this technology is 179 years old, Morse Code or Continuous Wave code is the oldest electronic means of public communication. Originally designed in 1838 by Samuel Morse and perfected by Alfred Vail. In order to send the code Samuel and Alfred contributed to the creation of the electrical telegraph in 1836, finally testing the encoding as we know it in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore. Morse Code uses two symbols made up from the same signal but with different durations called dots and dashes (dits and dahs).

The International Morse Code (standardized in 1865 in Paris) encodes 26 latin letters (a-z) and the arabic numerals (0-9) without any distinction between upper and lower case, there are many variations or Morse Alphabets developed to encode more characters. Each symbol is formed from a combination of dots and dashes. The duration of a dot is the basic unit of time measurement, dashes have a duration of three dots. There is always a minimum of one space of signal absence between every dot and dash with a duration of a single dot, between each character there are three spaces and between each word there are seven spaces.

You can communicate morse code through any medium where you can control the on-off state duration a single signal, for example visible light, sound waves, radio waves and electric current. To increase encoding efficiency Morse Code was originally designed so that the duration of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character represented in English. Since the code has no set time durations per symbol its transmission rate (in words per minute) is commonly limited only by the capability of the receiver to decode it. 

Morse code was used extensively with the telegraph for international communications and as a vital part of radiotelegraphy in the [zeppelin attacks](http://marconiheritage.org/ww1-air.html) of WW1 and as the best means of aeronautical communication in WW 2. Officially the final comercial Morse Code transmission in the US happened on 1999 using the Samuel Morse original message: *What hath god wrought*. Aeronautical communications have been completely replaced by voice transmission over modern protocols such as [GMDSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Maritime_Distress_and_Safety_System).

The best known Morse Code is the **SOS** distress signal made up of three dots, three dashes and three dots (...---...), contrary to popular belief it isn't an abbreviation. To measure the speed of an operator, the standard words PARIS and CODEX where used. Historically to teach Morse Code the Koch (learn new letters progressively by mastering previous ones) and Farnsworth (learn by gradually increasing the interpretation speed) methods have been used. 

In the past, you needed a minimum interpretation speed of 5wpm to obtain an amateur radio license in the US, even if the average speed was 20wpm thanks to various Morse Code abbreviations or *Qcodes*. Upon receiving their licence, all comercial and amateur radio stations receive a *Call Sign* that serves as a unique identifier to comunicate with other stations. In Mexico, AM stations use the XE prefix and the FM stations the XH prefix in their call signs.

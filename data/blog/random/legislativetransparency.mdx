# Congress #

A congress is a group of people established in accordance to the laws of a sovereign state to debate and approve the law of the land, meaning that they are the only one with legislative power. Its members (deputies and senators) represent the interests of the general population, that is why they are elected by the people. Aside from creating laws they also debate internal government issues, suggest actions regarding international relationships, supervise government expenditures and continuously check if the executive branch of the government is doing its work by asking its members questions with regards to their actions.

In most democracies there is a division of power into three separate institutions:

1. The executive power, controlled by the president, its cabinet, governors and mayors. They enforce the laws established by congress and may propose new laws.
2. The legislative power, controlled by the congress and the legislative councils. They create and approve new laws.
3. The judicial power, controlled by the supreme court of justice, the attorney general and the local judicial instances. They decide if the law has been broken.

For a congress to be considered democratic it must:

* Be representative, elected by all citizens in free and fair elections, with regular elections to ensure continuous representation.
* Be the only legislative authority, no other group of people can make laws.
* Be transparent, every congress proceeding is open to the public who can visit their congress or inquire about their process.
* Perform rigorous congressional scrutiny on the executive branch actions.
* A congress may also include public hearings and public law petitions.

Although technically members of congress vote on laws based on their own reasoning and consciousness in reality they usually vote based on the goals of their political party. Every person has the right to know how laws are being made and what are the resulting laws, the media is an important ally to congress so that people can access unbiased, accurate and verifiable information. Ideally congress must represent every aspect of its society and since women represent half of the population a congress with few or no women cannot be truly representative.

The separation of powers isn't so clear in a parliamentary system where ministries are members of the executive and the legislative branches. Most democratic countries have a Congress that is a mix of presidential and parliamentary systems. The main characteristic of the parliamentary system is that the public doesn't elect the executive branch, instead it elects their congress members who then decide who will be in the executive branch.

Congress may be composed of one or two legislative chambers. Unicamerality is usually a more direct, less expensive and faster system however there is no way to guarantee territorial representation or be sure that there are no hidden internal chamber influences. Bicamerality means that the chamber is divided into two independent bodies that must agree together on the approval of every law, this makes for an enriched debate and an internal balance check however it's more autocratic since it doubles the law making process.

Congresses are governed by a set of special laws usually separated from the general public laws, this are called the organic laws of congress or the intensive legislative regulations. They are based primarily on the constitution and then expanded by congress itself. This body of laws can be subdivided into three categories:

1. Laws specific to the power that congress has including their privileges and immunities. Also they address congress property, congress budget and access to their meetings, for example the police may not be able to enter a chamber in session since it is considered part of the executive branch.
2. Rules that govern the procedures of the legislatures, they are based on the constitution but can be vetoed at any time by the congress itself.
3. Special laws that apply to everything said and done by congress, including special financial, archival and copyright laws.

Congress members have special rights and immunities that exempt them from certain aspects of the general law, this is with the main goal of performing a free debate without worrying that their opinions may carry a punishment even if that opinion or act may be considered illegal outside of the chamber. In some countries this immunity apply only when a proceeding is taking place and in others it applies outside of the chamber. When a member of congress violates the law and it wasn't a necessary part of the legislative process its immunity can be lifted by the other members of congress.

The rules that govern the procedures are also important since they allow for a balanced process where members have time to speak their opinions but also there are time constraints to reach a final vote. Members of congress are expected to conduct in an orderly manner however the circumstances and intensity of the debates makes it easy for people to lose their temper, interrupt or even make accusations and use offensive language, all of this is mediated by the speaker of the house. The presiding officer, president, spokesperson or speaker of the house acts as a moderator and he is the one who breaks ties when voting. Aside from the president there may be other titles inside the chamber like the committee chairmen or the party bloc leaders.

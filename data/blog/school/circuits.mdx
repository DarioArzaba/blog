# Introduction

In addition to linear circuits there are non-linear circuits, however they are models that allow to describe and predict the overall behavior of an electrical system. It is due in:

- DIRECT current analysis (DC).
- Transitory analysis
- Analysis in alternating current (AC or FASORIAL).
- Analysis of the frequency response.

Some elementary tools to analyze a simple resistive circuit are:

- Nodal analysis.
- Mesh analysis.
- Superposition analysis.
- Source transformation.
- Thévenin Theorem
- Norton Theorem.

**Load ** is a physical phenomenon where the electron difference between two bodies occasion that the electrons look for the balance by generating a current of electrons. The load may be positive (less electrons) or negative (more electrons), in rare occations corresponding to a flow of protons, the electron movement is easier.

**current ** is the loading load. The load unit is **coulomb **, defined in terms of **ampere ** as the total load (Q) that passes by a current of 1 ampere within the cross section of a wire at a second $ 1A = \ Frac {1c} {1S} $ .. An electron has then a load of $ -1.602 \ times10 ^ -19c $. The instant amount of load is represented by (q) or (q (t)).

The current is important because its variation (amount of load transmitted) allows transmitting information. The current has a significant value and an address, therefore it can be considered as the speed of the load that passes through a reference point, $ I (t) = \ Frac {dq} {DT} $. The current is defined in amperes and can be constant (CD), sinusoidal or alternating (CA), exponential or sinusoidal muffled.
$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Total transfered charge in the time interval}\\
	i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt}\\
	\int_{t_o}^{t} i(t) dt = \int_{t_o}^{t} \frac{q(t)-q(t_o)}{dt} dt\\
	\int_{t_o}^{t} i(t) dt = q(t)-q(t_o) \\
	q(t) = \int_{t_o}^{t} i(t) dt^{'} + q(t_o)\\
	\text{With constant current}\\
	q(t) = It\\
	\text{Maximum total charge transferred in the interval}\\
	q^{'}(t) = 0\\
	\text{Average current in the time interval}\\
	I = \frac{Q}{dt}
\end{gathered}
$$

Any element of a circuit has as a minimum two terminals to connect other elements. Push the load through the element requires an energy expenditure or work called **Voltage ** whose unit is the volt equivalent to 1J / C. That is to say that the voltage is the difference of potential between the terminals, the voltage may exist without supplying a current as in the case of the batteries.

For conservation of energy, the energy worn to move to the load of one terminal to another is expressed in electrical energy, heat or acoustic. To distinguish between the energy supplied to the element and which the element supplies a sign for the tension between a terminal and another.

> If the tension is positive and the current enters through the positive terminal, the signs are preserved. A negative tension invests the signs. A negative current is as if entering the other terminal.

If you have a 1 V tension, where to transmit 1 c you need 1 j then we say that the **power ** or transfer rate is 1 watt. The power is proportional to the current and the tension. $ p = vi $.

> If we assume that an element has a 5V tension from A A B, this means that 5J is needed for each load coulomb that moves through the element. If we establish a current of A A B of 2A, this means that 2 coulomb is transmitted per second, then 10 j of energy is being spent per second, that is, the object absorbs 10 W of automatically power of the element that is injecting 2A current.

In other words if the current and the signs of tension polarity are set in such a way that the current between the positive end talks about the absorbed or supplied power of the element expressed by $ p = vi $. Now if the resumed is negative, the element absorbs negative potential energy or generates it.

> By general convention, the current arrows towards the positive tension terminal are drawn, regardless of whether the element is absorbing or supplying power.

A simple element of a circuit **is a mathematical model to describe an electrical device of two terminals that could not be subdivided into other devices. They are classified as ACUERO to the relationship between the current and the tension of the element. If the tension between the ends is linearly proportional to the current it can be a ** resistor **, if the tension is proportional to the derivative of the current it can be a ** coil **, if the tension is proportional to the integral of The current can be a capacitor **.

If the tension or current are independent and do not depend on the other, independent sources are considered. There are special sources that depend on the tension or current from other parts of the circuit called dependent sources as in the use of **transistors **.

> Of the power we can infer energy. $ E = PT $. For example, a battery that supplies 6W constants in 5 minutes (300s) generates a 1.8 kJ energy.

A **independent tension source ** $ V_S $ is characterized in that the voltage between the terminals is independent of the current that goes through the element. It is considered an ideal source, since if it never changed the tension between terminals, it could supply infinite energy.

> For example, the battery of a 12 V car will keep its tension relatively constant while the current supplied or delivered does not exceed some amperes. If the current is positive and flows out of the positive terminal, the battery will generate power for the headlights, if it flows into the positive terminal, this alternator is loaded.

The domestic outlet is approaching an independent tension source. However, when we connect many elements we can overcome current demand by causing a temporary tension fall.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Voltage from a domestic circuit}\\
	v_s = 115\sqrt{2}\cos(2\pi60)(t) \text{ V}\\
	\text{True for currents lower than 20 A}
\end{gathered}
$$

The most important thing about remembering in the case of the sources is that the positive or negative sign does not represent that the terminal is positive with respect to the other but is an amount of Volts more positive than the other, although both are actually negative. A source of independent voltage with a constant tension is commonly known as a source of independent direct current tension.

One **independent current source ** $ I_S $ is characterized in that the current that passes through the element is independent of the voltage between its terminals. If the current is constant, we call independent direct current source, if the current varies but it is independent, call it a separate alternating current power source. This ideal source delivers in theory an infinite power since it produces the same current regardless of the tension between its terminals.

> Usually independent tension sources supply their constant tension or voltage and have an almost null current. A common error is to assume that independent sources of current supply their constant current and have a zero voltage, the voltage in these sources may vary greatly and depends on the rest of the circuit to which it is connected.

** dependent sources ** or controlled are ideal sources where your voltage or current depends directly on another element in the circuit. To distinguish between independent sources and dependents are used diamonds as symbols.

- K is an adimitation adjustment constant.
- G is an I / V or A / V adjustment factor
- R is a V / I or V / A adjustment factor

The sources are considered active elements for being able to deliver power to other elements. However, some passive elements do the same as the capacitors who store energy and then they can deliver it.


1. Leave 7A on the positive side of an i (S) with 8V. The potcia absorbed = - (7a) (+ 8V) = -56W
2. Salt 2a on the negative side of an element with 8V. The absorbed power = - (2A) (- 8V) = 16W
3. Join 5A on the negative side of the VX element with 12V. The absorbed power = + (5A) (- 12V) = -60W
4. Salt 8A on the negative side of an element with 20V. The power absorbed = - (8A) (- 20V) = 160W
5. Leave (0.25) (VX) on the negative source side that Dep. Of V. with 20V. = (-0.25A / V) (- 12V) (- 20V) = - 60W

The interconnection between two or more circuit elements forms an electrical network **, if the network contains a closed path is also an electrical circuit **.

** Resistance ** (linear) is the simplest passive element and its properties are described by Ohm's law, designed in 1827 by Georg Simon Ohm and 46 years earlier by Henry Cavendish.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	v = R(i)
\end{gathered}
$$

This law establishes that the tension between the ends of a conductor is proportional to the current flowing by the material, where the proportionality constant between both is given by R, or the natural resistance of the material that prevents the electron current from flowing. Your unit is the ohm $ \ omega = 1 \ Frac {V} {a} $.

By plotting the linear resistance of a material such as the relationship between its current and its voltage we obtain a linear equation that tells us that by increasing the current or the voltage increases the resistance. Usually resistance is positive although negative resistances can be simulated (material helps electrons to flow) by special circuits.

> Again it is recalled that this resistance is an ideal. The resistance that we use are linear in determined current, tension and power intervals. Also the same chemical material changes its chemical properties due to other factors such as temperature.

Like other elements, the power that absorbs a resistance is given by $ p = V (i) $ but it is always positive, they have no way of generating energy, on the contrary it dissipates it. The resistors avoid the flow of electrons by transforming the energy administered (power) from its electric form to light or heat.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ways to calculate absorbed work}\\
	p = v(i) = (i^2)(R)= (v^2)(R)
\end{gathered}
$$

** Conductance ** (g) is the proportion between current and tension $ g = \ Frac {i} {V} = \ Frac {1} {R} $, or the opposite of the resistance, which is a CANCA . The unit of conductance is Siemens. $ S = \ Frac {1a} {V} $. The power equations can be expressed in terms of the conductance.
$$
\begin{gathered}
	p = v(i) = (v^2)(G) = \frac{i^2}{G}
\end{gathered}
$$

> A resistor of 2 ohm has a 1/2 S conductance and if a current of 5 A flows through it, by the Ohm Law presented a voltage of 10 V in the terminals, finally absorbing 50 W of power.

A ** short circuit ** is an element whose resistance is 0 ohms. Given $ v = R (i) $ This element has a tension of 0 V regardless of the current that presents. A ** open circuit ** is an element whose resistance approaches infinity, analogously analogously in this case is 0 A, regardless of the tension of the element. Recalling that wires even if they have a small resistance this is negligible (0 ohms) and therefore in the schemes are considered short circuits.

Any material, excluding superconductors, has natural resistance to the flow of current. In the models it is generally assumed that the wires of the circuits are short circuits perfect with null resistance, however in reality if they have their own resistance.

The resistance depends on the ** resistivity ** of the material and the ** geometry ** of the device. Resistivity & \ Rho & is a measure of the ease with which electrons flow through a material. It is the quotient of the electrical field (V / M) between the current density (A / M ^ 2). Your units are $ \ omega \ times M $.

Resistivity depends directly on temperature. In some texts, especially in chemistry, its reciprocal is used ** conductivity **, $ \ omega \ Times \ Sigma $. The resistance of a wire is obtained by multiplying resistivity by the length of the wire between the area of ​​its transverse section.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	R = \rho(\Omega cm)\left(\frac{\lambda(cm)}{A(cm^2)}\right)\\
\end{gathered}
$$

The resistivity is determined empirically when choosing the material and applying a current at a given temperature. The natural resistance, although minimal, absorbing power and generated its own heat that can be measured. The thicker wires have a lower resistance, absorbing a lower amount of power and dissipating heat more easily.

In practice it is sought to use the wire with the least caliber or thickness but whose resistance does not affect the operation of the circuit. The standard system to determine the thickness of a wire is the AWG (American Wire Gauge). The AWG values among smaller correspond to a larger wire.

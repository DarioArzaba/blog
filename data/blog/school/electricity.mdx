	F_{1->3}  = \frac{(9\times10^{-9})|(1\times10^{-9})(5\times10^{-9})|}{(0.02 m)^2} = 112\mu N \implies \vec{F_{1->3}}  = - 112 \mu N (\vec{i})\\
	F_{2->3}  = \frac{(9\times10^{-9})|(-3\times10^{-9})(5\times10^{-9})|}{(0.04 m)^2} = 84\mu N \implies \vec{F_{2->1}}  = + 84 \mu N (\vec{i})\\
	\vec{F_{12->3}} = - 112 \mu N (\vec{i}) + 84 \mu N (\vec{i}) = - 28 \mu N (\vec{i})
\end{gathered}

* Calculate strength that exercises Q1 and Q2 in Q3

$$
\begin{gathered}
	q1 = q2 = 2\mu C \quad q3 = 4\mu C \quad \vec{r_1} = (0,0.3) \quad \vec{r_2} = (0,-0.3) \quad \vec{r_3} = (0.4,0)\\
	F_{1->3}y + F_{2->3}y = 0 \land F_{1->3} = F_{2->3}\\
	F_{1->3} = \frac{(9\times10^{-9})(2\times10^{-6})(4\times10^{-6})}{(0.05 m)^2} = 0.29 N \implies F_{2->3} = 0.29N\\
	F_{1->3}x = F_{2->3}x = (0.29 N)(\cos(\theta)) = 0.23 N\\
	F_{12->3} = 0.23 N + 0.23 N = 0.46 N\hat{i}

	\hat{r} = \frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|} = \frac{(1.2m)i+(-1.6m)j}{2m} = 0.6i - 0.8j\\
	\vec{E} = \frac{kq}{r^2}(\hat{r}) = \frac{(9\times10^{9})(-8\times10^{-9})}{(2m)^2}(\hat{r}) = -(11N/C)i + (14N/C)j
\end{gathered}
$$

**Equation Straight Field**

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dE = \frac{k(dQ)}{r^2}\\
	r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \quad E = Ex \quad \lambda_{dy} = \frac{dQ}{dy}\\
	dy\lambda = dQ \implies dQ = \frac{Qdy}{2a} \implies dE = \frac{kQdy}{2ar^2}\\
	dE_x = (dE)(\cos(\theta)) \land \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{R} \implies dE_x = \frac{kQdyx}{2ar^2R}\\
	E_x = \frac{kQ}{2a} \int \frac{xdy}{r^3} = \frac{kQ}{2a} \int_{-a}^{a} \frac{xdy}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}} = \int \frac{xdy}{(x^2)(1+\frac{y^2}{x^2})^{3/2}}\\
	y=x\tan(\theta) \land y^2 = x^2\tan^2(\theta) \land dy = x\sec^2(\theta)d\theta\\
	\int \frac{x(xsex^2(\theta))d\theta}{((x^2)(1+\frac{x^2\tan(\theta)}{x^2}))^{3/2}} \implies \int \frac{x^2sex^2(\theta)d\theta}{(x^3)(\sec^3(\theta))} \implies \int \frac{d\theta}{(x)(\sec(\theta))}\\
	\frac{1}{x} \int \frac{d\theta}{\sec(\theta)} \implies \frac{1}{x} \int \cos(\theta)d\theta \implies \frac{1}{x}\sin(\theta)\implies \frac{y}{xR}\\
	\frac{y}{x\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \implies \frac{a - (-a)}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} \implies \frac{kQ2a}{2ax\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}\\
	E_x = \frac{kQ}{x\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} \land a = \frac{L}{2}\\
\end{gathered}

	E_x = \frac{kxQ}{r^3} \implies E_x = \int_{0}^{R} \frac{k2\pi\sigma rx dr}{r^3}\\
	E_x = \frac{\sigma x}{2\epsilon_0}\left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{x^2}+1}} \right]

# Charge

The Greeks observed ** Electrical Interactions ** When rubbing with wool generating a load. A person (insulator) acquires cargo when rubbing his shoes with a nilon carpet, releasing the load by touching a driver.

1. Plastic rod with skin dissipates positive particles leaving it negative.
2. Glass rod with silk dissipates the negative particles leaving it positive.
3. There are two types of load, nicknamed negative and positive by Benjamin Franklin.

** ** elementary forces are: electromagnetism, severity, strong and nuclear debil nuclear.

** Electric spark ** comes from the addition of electrons on the surface of a non-conductive material (insulating) towards a conductor.

** Insulators ** tend to accommodate or give up electrons, so it is easier than having a load differential.

The ** Law of Electric Loads ** Establishes that two similar charges are repelled, while the opposing charges are naturally attached to try to achieve balance.

The ** Load Conservation Law ** states that the total electrical charge of an isolated system is preserved.

** Atoms ** are composed of three particles, the electron with negative charge, the proton with positive charge and the neutron without electric charge. Even though the proton and the electron have the same magnitude of charge their masses are different.

By ** ionization ** An atom that has the same number of protons and electrons is neutral, with a deficit of electrons is a positive ion and with an excess electron is a negative ion.

1. Atomic number (protons) = $ Z $
2. Mass number (protons + neutrons) = $ A $
3. Electron loading (neutral atom) = $ -Z (E) $
4. Load Protons = $ Z (E) $
5. Neutrons = $ N = (A-Z) $.
6. Atomic Mass = $ M_A = ZM_P + NM_N $
7. Atomic weight = $ A_R $ = relative atomical mass
8. Molar Mass = $ M=A_R \times \frac{1G}{MOL}$

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Fundamental Macroscopic Fundamental Charge}\\
	e = 1.6021764871402 \times 10^{-19}C\\
	q_e = -e \quad q_p = +e\\
	m_e = 9.10938215 \times 10^{-31}Kg\\
	m_p = 1.672621637 \times 10^{-27}Kg\\
	m_n = 1.674927211 \times 10^{-27}Kg\\
	N_A = 6.022140857 \times 10^{23}
\end{gathered}
$$

All material is ** driver ** However, some are considered insulating, semiconductors or superconductors due to their natural conductivity coefficient.

In general, a macroscopic body receives its ** net load ** of excess or lack of electrons, this load tends to be a minuscule compared to the total load of the body.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Carga Total}\\
	q = (e)(Np - Ne)\\
	\text{Np: Numero Protones}\\
	\text{Np: Numero Electrones}
\end{gathered}
$$

The charge of an object is modified by direct contact or by induction by separating the charges within the regions of a macroscopic body. By grounding an infinite conductor, we release the difference in charge by induction.

The charges of an insulator cannot move easily, however, if there can be a reorientation of the internal molecules of the insulator, generating electrical forces. This is called ** polarization **.

A ** point load ** is the net load of a body whose geometry is negligible. Coulomb studied this type of charges and using a torsion balance determined that the electric force generated by two point charges is proportional to the inverse of their distance squared.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ley de Coulomb}\\
	\vec{F_{1->2}} = \frac{(k)(q_1)(q_2)}{|r_{12}|^2}\hat{a_{12}}\\
	r_{12} = (r)(\hat{a_{12}}) \land r = |r_{12}| \implies \hat{a_{12}} = \frac{r_{12}}{|r_{12}|} = \frac{(\vec{r2}-\vec{r1})}{|(\vec{r2}-\vec{r1})|}\\
	\vec{F_{1->2}} = \left( \frac{(k)(q_1)(q_2)}{|r_{12}|^3} \right)(\vec{r2}-\vec{r1})\\
	\text{Constante de Coulomb: } k = 8.987551787\times10^{9}\frac{Nm^2}{C^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\\
	\text{Permitividad eléctrica del vacio: } \epsilon_0 = 8.854\times10^{-12}
\end{gathered}
$$

It is assumed that the charges are in a vacuum, in the air we consider that the force changes 1N for every 2000N. The (k) is the real value of the fundamental charges, however it is convenient to separate their units in Coulomb as it is proportional to the Ampere. Knowing this, 1 C is roughly equivalent to $ 6 \ times10 ^ {18} $ electrons. If the charges are distributed, the electric force in another point charge will be the vector sum of the forces of all the other point charges (superposition).
The interaction of charges by induction suggests that as with gravity there is a modification of space itself, this modification happens even if the charge is isolated and is called ** electric field ** and we represent it by the electric force that generates a charge at any point in space.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q} \implies \vec{F} = (q)\vec{E}
\end{gathered}
$$

We consider the electric field as a ** vector field ** that describes the force experienced by a point in space depending on the magnitude of the charge at that point, it is assumed that the charge at the test point is positive, however the ** direction of the force ** generated by the field will depend on the load at that point.

The direction of the force depends on the charge at the test point, however the ** direction of the field ** depends on the charge at the source that generates the electric field.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\vec{E} = \frac{kq}{|r|^2}(\hat{r})
\end{gathered}
$$

A ** uniform field ** is one where the magnitude and direction of the forces in a region are parallel. The fields in ** charge distributions ** also overlap (where dQ and r depend on the geometry of the distribution).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dE = \frac{k(dQ)}{r^2}\\
	\text{Densidad de carga lineal} \implies \lambda = \frac{Q}{L} = \frac{C}{m}\\
	\text{Densidad de carga superficial} \implies \sigma = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{C}{m^2}\\
	\text{Densidad de carga volumetrica} \implies \rho = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{C}{m^3}
\end{gathered}
$$

The ** field lines ** are imaginary lines or curves that start from the positive sources and end in the negative sources whose tangent at any point is the force vector of the total field at that point. It is an error to believe that charges flow through the electric field since the effect it has on space is instantaneous.

2D fields can be considered field maps with contour lines, the closer the lines are, the greater the magnitude of the field at that point.

An ** electric dipole ** is a pair of point charges of equal magnitude and opposite signs, for example a water molecule. When an electric dipole is placed in a uniform field the magnitudes of the charges cancel out and the net force of the dipole is zero. However, if the forces do not act on the same line as the field, the dipole does generate a torque.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\vec{t\pm} = \frac{r}{2}\sin(\phi)\\
	|t\pm| = (qE)\frac{r}{2}\sin(\phi)\\
	\vec{T} = (2)(qE)\frac{r}{2}\sin(\phi) \implies (qE)r\sin(\phi)
\end{gathered}
$$

Where phi is the angle between the field and the line that joins the dipole, therefore $ r \ sin (\ phi) $ is the distance between the charges perpendicular to the field. The product between the charge (q) and the separation (r) of a dipole is the magnitude of the ** electric dipole moment **, whose vector has a direction equal to the dipole axis.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	p = qr\\
	\vec{T} = (pE)\sin(\phi)\\
	\vec{T} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
\end{gathered}
$$


As the dipole rotates, the torque that the field performs is ** work ** that translates into a change in potential energy. Since work is by definition the negative difference of potentials we can define the ** potential energy ** of the system in terms of phi.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW = Td\phi = -pE\sin(\phi) \implies W = \int_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2} (-pE\sin(\phi))d\phi\\
	W = pE\cos(\phi_2) - pE\cos(\phi_1)\\
	W = U_1 - U_2 \implies U = -pE\cos(\phi) = U = -\vec{p}\cdot\vec{E}
\end{gathered}
$$

** Gauss's Law ** is a tool that takes advantage of the symmetric properties of charges to describe them. It states that any charge distribution enclosed in a surface can be fully described only by calculating the values of its field on the surface.

We call the field that we detect on the surface ** electric flow **.

1. Net positive charge has outgoing electric flux.
2. Net negative charge has incoming electric flow.
3. Balanced loads, uniform fields or no load have no flow.
4. The net flow is proportional to the contained charge.
5. The net flow is independent of the size of the surface.

If we have a uniform flow of water passing through a wire of area A, we calculate it in terms of the volumetric flow rate for time. If the flow velocity is uniform and the area A is perpendicular to this velocity then $ v (A) = \ frac {dV} {dt} $. If the area A is inclined with respect to the flow velocity then $ vA \ cos (\ phi) = \ frac {dV} {dt} $. Finally, if we consider the area as a vector we obtain $ \ frac {dV} {dt} = \ vec {v} \ cdot \ vec {A} $.

The ** electric flow ** that passes through a flat surface in a uniform field is defined in a similar way to a flow of water, substituting the speed of the fluid for the electric field. In this case since the surface is not closed if the area increases then the flow also increases.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = EA\cos(\phi) \frac{Nm^2}{C}\\
	\Phi = \vec{E}\cdot\vec{A}\\
	\text{Vector A es Normal al Area}\\
	\vec{A} = A\hat{n}
\end{gathered}
$$

La dirección del flujo electrico entrante o saliente esta dada por su signo, note que "afuera" y "adentro" dependen del vector unitario normal $\hat{n}$. Si el campo electrico no es uniforme o el area no es una superficie plana entonces dividimos (A) en areas infinitesimales, cada diferencial tiene su propio vector normal $\hat{n}$, por tanto $d\vec{A} = dA(\hat{n})$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Integral de Superficie del Flujo}\\
	A = dA \implies d\Phi = (E\cos(\phi))(dA) = \vec{E}\cdot\vec{A}(dA)\\
	\Phi = \int(E\cos(\phi))(dA) = \int\vec{E}\cdot\vec{A}(dA)
\end{gathered}
$$

Given the relationship between a point charge or enclosed distribution and a surface, we can calculate the electric field as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Charge in sphere}\\
	E = \frac{kq}{R^2} = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0R^2}\\
	\vec{E} = (E)(A) = \frac{q(4 \pi R^2)}{4\pi\epsilon_0R^2} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

From this last equation we deduce that the electric flow of a charge enclosed in a sphere, as with a box, does not depend on the size or radius of the sphere, only on the charge. If the surface is irregular we can consider it as a deformation of the sphere that generates an angle, in other words we consider the area differential of the irregular surface as a flat surface in a uniform field:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Puntual charge in an irregular surface}\\
	d\Phi = \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} \implies \Phi = \oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}
\end{gathered}
$$

Finally, if we consider multiple enclosed charges and their superimposed total field, we find the general form of Gauss's law.

> The total electric flux through any closed surface is going to be equal to the net electric charge within the surface divided by the electric permittivity of the vacuum.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Gauss Law}\\
	\Phi = \oint E_T\cos(\phi)dA = \oint \vec{E}_T\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_T}{\epsilon_0}
\end{gathered}
$$

Let us remember that the closed surfaces that we use in our models are imaginary, they are mathematical reference tools that do not necessarily correspond to a material surface and we call them ** Gaussian Surfaces **.

| Distribution | Test Point | Field Magnitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Point Load q | From q to r | $E = \frac{kq}{r^2}$ |
| Conductive sphere surface R | r > R | $E = \frac{kq}{r^2}$ |
| Conductive sphere surface R | r < R | $E = 0$ |
| Infinite wire load per unit length | From the wire to r | $E = \frac{2k\lambda}{r}$ |
| Infinite driving cylinder R for lambda | r > R | $E = \frac{2k\lambda}{r}$ |
| Infinite driving cylinder R for lambda | r < R | $E = 0$ |
| Uniform load Q on solid insulating sphere R | r > R | $E = \frac{Q}{r^2}$ |
| Uniform load Q on solid insulating sphere R | r < R | $E = \frac{Qr}{R^3}$ |
| Infinite sheet load per unit area | Any point | $E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} $ |
| Opposite Conductor Plates | Any point between plates | $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$ |


Gauss's law tends to be used to find the field generated by a distribution or to find the distribution that generates a field. In real life it is usually used to find the field that generates a charge distribution within a ** conductor **, this calculation is usually easy given a property of solid conductors:

> Any excess electrostatic charge inside a solid conductor tends to be located on the surface of the same given the repulsion with the free ions and electrons of the neutral atoms.

To solve problems with Gauss's Law, it is necessary to enclose the distribution in spheres, cylinders, or planes.

Some conclusions regarding drivers are:

1. The electric field of every internal point is zero.
2. The excess static charge of a solid conductor is distributed on its surface.
3. A charge within a cavity of a solid conductor causes the surface of the cavity to have an opposite charge.

From these conclusions, Gauss's Law can be experimentally verified by means of the ** Faraday Icebox **:

* A positively charged sphere is placed hanging from an insulator inside a conductive metal container.
* The sphere induces negative charges on the inner surface (cavity) and positive charges on the surface.
* When the sphere touches the container it becomes part of the surface and therefore loses its positive charge
* The charge of the sphere tries to move away from the negative charge on the inner surface, spreading on the outer surface.
* The sphere is left uncharged and the originally neutral container is left with an excess charge on its surface.

This principle is also the one used by a ** Van de Graaff electrostatic generator **.

* A band rotates with a brush at the bottom that scatters its electrons.
* The brush is grounded discharging those electrons and leaving the positive band.
* The positive band rotates and at the top another brush connects the positive charge with a metal sphere.
* Since the sphere is thin, the difference by induction between the internal and external part is strong.
* This propels the positive charge of the band to the outer surface of the sphere charging it rapidly.

We use ** Electrostatic Shielding ** like ** Faraday Cages ** to protect objects such as sensitive electronic instruments from external electric fields. The boxes are conductive and the field flows through them generating an attractive force on the free electrons of the conductor bringing them by induction closer to the source of the field and leaving the other side of the box positive, essentially polarizing the object.

This polarization occurs in the ** opposite surfaces ** of the object simulating two opposite charged plates that generate their own electric field with the magnitude of the external field but in the opposite direction, by superposition the external and internal electric field is canceled, eliminating the electric field inside the box.

Note that there is a direct relationship between the surface density of charge on a conductor and the field generated at a point just outside the conductor. In general, the density of an irregular surface changes from one point to another, however the direction of the field will always be perpendicular to the differential of the surface. Thanks to this we know that the magnitude of the field at any point just outside the charged surface is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_{\perp} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}
\end{gathered}
$$

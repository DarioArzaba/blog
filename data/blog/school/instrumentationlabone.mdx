**Measuring Instrument or System**

![Measuring Instrument](/static/images/notes/MeasureSystemInstruLab.png)

The device detects an input with sensors or transducers. Then it process the input signal in its signal processing unit or DAQ (Data Acquisition System). In this process it is usually converted from analog to digital values. Then it finally sends the data to a display, recorder or HMI (Human Machine Interface). HMI's in the industry are robust devices capable of withstanding drops, dust, water, oils, radiation, salt and even explosive damage or blasts.

**Sensors**

Device that responds to any change in physical, chemical or even biological phenomena. The phenomena will change the physical, chemical or electromagnetic properties of the sensors themselves. The sensor's change will be processed into a more usable form like a voltage or current signal that the DAQ can condition (amplify, filter, convert etc). The relationship between the phenomena's input and the sensor's output needs to be linear, if not we need to calibrate the sensor to a reference value or standard to linearize its output. 

![Thermocouple Sensor](/static/images/notes/ThermocoupleExampleInstruLab.png)

For example, thermocouples are sensors that measure temperature at their junction (union of two different metals) producing a voltage that can then be measured by a voltmeter. The voltage originates from the Seebeck effect of metals when subjected to a temperature gradient. The thermocouple uses two different metals to measure their Seebeck voltage differential relative to a cold reference point, usually room temperature or 25°.

Note that the range of temperatures that the thermocouple will be able to measure depends on the range on which voltage and temperature proportionality for both metals remain linear. A transducer is the part of the sensor that is the first in contact with the phenomena and usually its the one responsible for transforming the phenomena's energy into electricity.

## Classification ##

**Sensor Classification by Phenomena**

![Sensor Classification Phenomena](/static/images/notes/ThermocoupleInstruLab.png)

**Sensor Classification by Power**

* Active: Sensors that don't require an external power source since they generate power themselves (self generating) from the quantity they measure. Note that this sensors are calibrated to take into account the energy they consume in their measurements (Power Consumption Rating).
* Passive: Sensor that do require an external power source to function. Most resistive, inductive and capacitive sensors are passive. Note that inductive sensors will measure mostly metals while capacitive sensors measure a broader variety of materials.

**Sensor Classification by Output**

* Analog: Sensors that convert the phenomena to a *time-continuous* electrical form. For example thermocouples, RTD's or strain gauges.
* Digital: Sensors that convert the phenomena to a *time-discrete* electrical form meaning a series of electrical pulses. For example encoders.

**Inverse Sensors**

Inverse sensors are *Piezoelectric* devices made of crystals that generate an output voltage when subjected to a vertical external force. We call them inverse since they can also act as actuators meaning that we can generate a horizontal force or vibration by applying an input voltage.

**General Classification**

![General Classification](/static/images/notes/GeneralInstrumentClassificationInstruLab.png)

* Electrical instruments: They measure electrical quantities like power, voltage or current using a mechanical system that due to its inertia is prone to have a limited time response. They are made up of passive elements like resistors, inductors and capacitors, in contrast to electronic instruments that are made up of non linear semiconductor devices like diodes or transistors.
* Absolute: Output is in terms of physical constraints. For example a tangent galvanometer, absolute electrometer or Rayleigh's current balance.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Tangent Galvanometer Relation}\\
	i = \frac{2r\beta_{x}}{\mu_{0} n}\tan(\theta)\\
	n = \text{ Number Turns}\\
	r = \text{ Turn radius}\\
	\beta_{x} = \text{ Horizontal Magnetic Flux Density}\\
	\mu_{o} = \text{ Permeability Of Free Space}\\
	\mu_{o} = (4\pi) \times 10^{-7} T\\
	\theta = \text{ Deflection produced}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Secondary: Output is in terms of calibration when compared to absolute instruments. For example commercial measuring instruments like micrometer, caliper, level or gauge block.
* Digital: Output in numeric form. They are more accurate by reducing human error when observing the measurement. For example a digital multimeter.
* Analog: Output varies as it measures. Needle pointer indicates the magnitude. Prone to human error since it depends on the estimated observed position of the pointer. For example an analogue multimeter.
* Deflection: A pointer deflects to the measure of the quantity, meaning that the quantity is measured by the net deflection. For example a permanent magnet moving coil ammeter or a simple weight pressure gauge scale.
* Indicating: Indicates the current magnitude with a dial that moves on the graduated dial. Voltmeter, ammeter, power factor meter.
* Integrating: Measures total energy supplied over a time interval via summation, meaning that the total displayed is a product of the time and the electrical quantity sampled. For example energy meters and watt-hour meters.
* Recording: Records the current magnitude over a period of time. In a seismometer the moving system carries a pen that lightly touches the paper sheet, the curve drawn on the paper will then be translated to its corresponding electrical magnitude.
* Null: In some phenomena it is convenient to measure the opposite effect needed to maintain a pointer stationary and then infer the value of the original quantity. For example a triple beam balance.

Deflection instruments depend on their calibration or reference value while null instruments need to have their opposing effect calibrated to a high accuracy therefore deflection instruments tend to have lower accuracy and sensitivity than null instruments but fare better in dynamic conditions where their intrinsic response time is quicker.

## Static and Dynamic ##

**Static Characteristics**

Characteristics of measured quantities that are constant or change slowly relative to time. For example the temperature in a furnace.

* Accuracy: Closeness of the readings in relation to the true value.
* Absolute Accuracy: Percentage error of scale of range.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = |X_m - X_t|\\
	X_m = \text{ Measured Value}\\
	X_t = \text{ True Value}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Relative Accuracy: Percentage error of true value.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_r = \frac{|X_m - X_t|}{X_t}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Precision: Closeness of the readings in relation to each other. Usually related to the static characteristic of repeatability.

![Accuracy and Precision](/static/images/notes/AccuracyPressicionLabInstru.gif)

* Threshold: Smallest input after zero that the instrument can detect and output with certainty.
* Dead Space: Starting from zero its the continuous range of input values where no output is generated, meaning that the threshold is the highest value of the dead space.
* Resolution: Smallest *increment* between inputs after the threshold that the instrument can detect with certainty.
* Range: The scale range is the highest possible reading of an instrument.
* Span: Difference between the highest (range) and lowest (threshold) possible reading.
* Repeatability: Precision (closeness) of the instrument measuring a constant quantity in the same conditions while at the same time being turned on and off. High repeatability corresponds to a low drift. Generally we test the repeatability of instruments as a whole not of individual sensors.
* Drift: Offset in the instrument caused by an external phenomena like thermal EMF's, electromagnetic fields, vibration, temperature, wear, tear etc. Generally we test the drift of instruments as a whole not of individual sensors.
	* Zero Drift: Constant offset in the output for every input.
	* Span Drift: Also called sensitivity drift is a change in the slope of the output for every input. Note that there is possible to have a combination of zero drift and the span drift.
	* Zonal Drift: Sudden zero or span drift but localized to a specific range of inputs. Note that zonal drift is very difficult to compensate compared to zero drift or span drift.
* Sensitivity: Ratio between the magnitude of the output and the magnitude of the input (slope). Note that the unit of sensitivity is a combination of the output over the input.
* Hysteresis: Instrument phenomena where the instrument takes a long time to unload the energy that was being loaded into it. It happens in electrical and mechanical instruments when the energy we were measuring remains in a stressed part of the system for a while even after removing the original load. 

![Static Characteristics](/static/images/notes/StaticCharacteristicsInstruLab.png)

An example of hysteresis takes place in transformers where the magnetic field in the coil used to increase or decrease the voltage dissipates a little bit of the input energy (load) energy into heat (heat losses) creating an offset between the output when loading compared to when its unloading.

**Dynamic Characteristics**

Characteristics of measured quantities that change rapidly relative to time. For example when measuring force values as opposite force reactions introduce noise.

They can be divided into *Frequency* or *Time* characteristics.

* Time Characteristics: Related to the instrument's response (output) when applying a step function as input.
	* First Order Response
		* Rising Time: Time it takes the output to increase from 10% to 90%.
		* Time Constant (Tau): Time it takes to reach 63.2% of its maximum output.
		* Dead Time: Time until the first output is registered. Associated to the deadband. 
	* Second Order Response
		* Damping Factor (Gamma): Shape of the response.
			* If zero the system will oscillate.
			* If less than one the system will overshoot (underdamped system).
			* If equal to one the system will have a fast response (critically damped system).
			* If more than one the system will have a slow response (overdamped system).
		* Overshoot: Only when the damping factor is less than one we can measure the difference between the initial peak and the settling (smaller than 2%) output value.
		* Settling Time: Time until the output stabilize within a 2% or 5% difference compared to its final value.
		* Frequency Response: This and the Cut-Off frequency describe the response when the input changes by a known frequency, for example a sinusoidal output is expected to have a sinusoidal input for a lineal instrument.
* Frequency Characteristics: Related to the instrument's response (output) when applying a variable excitation over time (sinusoidal function input).
	* Frequency Response: At a certain point in frequency the stable output will start to decrease even if it continues oscillating.
	* Cut-Off frequency: Frequency at which the output falls to 70.7% of the stable output value. This is equivalent to -3dB from the stable output, and represents the point at which the output power is halved. Note that this can be related to the rising time.
	* Bandwidth: Range of frequencies between 0 and the Cut-Off frequency higher than 3dB. This characteristic indicates the instrument's response speed.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Overshoot } = \frac{\text{Max Peak} - \text{V Settling}}{\text{V Settling}} \times 100\% \\
	\text{Rising Time } = \frac{0.35}{\text{Cut-Off frequency}} 
\end{gathered}
$$

**Wheatstone and Schering Bridges**

![Wheatstone and Schering](/static/images/notes/BridgesUsedwithSensorsinLabInstru.png)

* Galvanometer: Device used to detect the *magnitude and direction* of a current. Works in the presence of a magnetic field. It can *only* measure DC and its used when designing bridges or potentiometers to detect the zero current by connecting it in series. High sensitivity but low accuracy compared to the ammeter.
* Ammeter: Device used to measure the *magnitude* of the current flowing through it. Works with or without a magnetic field. It can measure AC or DC and its used when designing electric circuits by connecting it in series. High accuracy but low sensitivity compared to the galvanometer. It can be a mechanical or electronic instrument that ideally has zero resistance.

**Resistive Sensors**

Resistive sensors can include resistive transducers or variable resistance transducers. Used to measure temperature, pressure, displacement, force, vibrations, etc. They are usually secondary transducers since they receive the output from a primary mechanical transducer to which they are calibrated.

Variable resistance transducer are based on the principle that resistance is proportional to the length of the conductor times its specific resistance (resistivity of the material) and inversely proportional to its area. $R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$ 

* Sliding Contact Devices: The most common type is the *potentiometer* and its variable resistance transducer. Used to measure linear and rotary or angular displacement.
* Wire resistance strain gauge: Used to measure force, stress and strain. The increase in length and decrease in cross section area from tension causes the resistance of its internal conductor to change. This resistance change is finally used to measure the input quantity.
* Thermistor: Resistivity of the material changes when subjected to a change in temperature. Made from oxides of manganese, nickel and cobalt.
* Thermocouple: Based on the Seebeck, Peltier and Thomson effects.
	* Seebeck: Two dissimilar elements joined at their ends experience an electromotive force in their junction.
	* Peltier: Voltage generated depends on the temperature of the junction.
	* Thomson: Voltage generated depends on the temperature gradient along the conductors in the circuit.

**Thermistor**

![Thermistor Types](/static/images/notes/ThermistorTypesInstruLab.png)

The Thermally Sensitive Resistor or Thermistor is a temperature sensing element composed of sintered semiconductor material with a large change in resistance from a small change in temperature. High accuracy from ±0.05% to ±0.02%. High sensitivity over a small temperature range. They can function with a small current reducing heat loss in its wiring. High electrical noise immunity and easy to interface to other electronic components.

Thermistors, unlike RTD's and thermocouples, don't have standards associated with their temperature-resistance curves, in other words each thermistor will have its own unique curve. Thermistors can have either a positive (PTC) or negative (NTC) temperature coefficients. A negative temperature coefficient means that as the temperature increases the resistance decreases.

 NTCs are the most common for temperature sensing and compensation however note that their curve is non linear outside of a small range of 0° to 70°. Their small mass make them susceptible to self heating errors and later prone to irreversible de-calibration (extreme drifting).
